	Green plants uses autotrohic nutrition. The procces of nutriton in green plant is called Photosynthesis.

## Photosynthesis 
	The procces by which green plants converts carbon dioxide, water and sunlight into glucose is called photosynnthesis.
 #### Steps of photosynthesis
 1) Sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll.
 2) Sunlight (light energy) is converted into chemical energy and water is split into H2 and O2.
 3) Carbon dioxide is reduced to carbohydrate
 *Equation* :  **$\ce{12H2O + 6CO2 ->[Chlorophyl][Sunlight] C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O}$
 **
 *Carbohydrates are stored as starch in plants*
##### How does plants get the required substances for photosynthesis?
1) CO2 : CO2 is taken by plants from the atmosphere. CO2 is absorbed by tiny pores present on the aerial part of the plant. These pores are called stomata. ![[Stomata.png]]
3) H2O : H2O is absorbed by the roots of the plant.

#### Displacement reaction
	Reaction in which an element replaces a lesser reactive element in called a displacement reaction.
 **$\ce{H2O ->[Electiricity] H2 + O2 }$

#### Combination reaction
	Reaction in which multiple simple substances react to form a single more complex product is called a combination reaction.
  **$\ce{H2 + O2 ->[\Delta] H2O }$**
#### Decomposition reaction
	Reaction in which a single comple reactant decomposes into multiple simpler  products. There are three type of decomposition
	
   1) ##### Photodecomposition 

			 Decomposition caused by light is called photodecomposition.
		 **$\ce{2AgCl ->[Sunlight] 2Ag + Cl2 }$
  2) ##### Thermal decomposition

			Decomposition caused by heat is called thermaldecomposition.
		**$\ce{2FeSO4 ->[\Delta] Fe2O3 + SO3 + SO2 }$
  3) ##### Electrolytic Decomposition

			Decomposition caused by electricty is called electrolytic decomposition
#### Double displacement reaction
	Reaction in which ions replaces other ions from thier compunds.
  **$\ce{AgNO3 + NaCl -> AgCl + NaNO3 }$**
#### Oxidation reaction
	Reaction in which a chemical substance gains an oxygen atom or loses an hydrogen atom is called a oxidation reaction. The substance which gains a oxygen atom or loses a hydrogen atom is said to be oxidized.
  **$\ce{2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO}$**
  
	in the above reaction copper is oxidised
#### Reduction reaction
	Reaction in which a chemical substance loses an oxygen atom or gains a hydrogen atom is called a reduction reaction. The substance which loses a ocygen atom or gains a hydrogen atom is said to be reduced.
  **$\ce{CuO + H2 -> Cu + H2O}$**

	In the above reaction copper is reduced.
#### Redox reaction
	Reaction in which oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously is called a redox reaction. Redox reaction is also called reduction oxidation reaction
  **$\ce{CuO + H2 -> Cu + H2O}$**

	In the above reaction CuO is reduced to Cu and H2 is oxidised to H2O

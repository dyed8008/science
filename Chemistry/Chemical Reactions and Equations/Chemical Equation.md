#### ** Chemical Equation **
	A chemical equation is the symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. 
example :
	**$\ce{H2 + O2 -> H2O}$**
>*reactant*
	Substances which react to form new substance are called reactant. They are generally on the left side of an equation
>*Product* 
	Substances create after a chemical reaction are called Products. They are generally on the right side of an equation
#### ** Balanced Chemical Equation **
	An equation in which the number of atoms of each element in the Reactant side is equalt to the number of atom of each element in the Product side
example :
	 **$\ce{2Mg =O2 -> 2MgO}$**

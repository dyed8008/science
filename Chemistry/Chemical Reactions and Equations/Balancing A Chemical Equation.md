### Why do we need to balance chemical equations?
	We need to balance chemical equations to obey the law of conseration of mass. 

### Balancing a chemical equation
 Equation : **$\ce{H2 + O2 -> H2O}$**
- Write the total number of atom of each element in a table

| Element      | Reactant | Product |
| ------------ | -------- | ------- |
| **$\ce{H}$** | 2        | 2       |
| **$\ce{O}$** | 2        | 1        |
- Multiply the number of atoms with suitable number until the equation is balanced

| Element      | Reactant | Product |
| ------------ | -------- | ------- |
| **$\ce{H}$** | 2*2=4    | 2*2=4   |
| **$\ce{O}$** | 2        | 1*2=2   |
- Write the equation with number with which it is multiplied at the front of the compound
**$\ce{2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O}$**

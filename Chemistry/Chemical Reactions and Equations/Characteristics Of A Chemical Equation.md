1) #### Change in state
		Physical state of the reactants changes to a different state in the products. 
	**$\ce{H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l)}$**
2) #### Change in colour 
		Colour of reactants change to a different colour in products.
	**$\ce{CuSO4(aq)(light blue) + Pb(s) -> PbSO4(s)(white) + Cu(s)}$**
3) #### Change in temperature
		Heat may be absorbed or released in a chemical reaction
	**$\ce{CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O + heat}$**
1) #### Evolution of gas
		In a reaction a gas may be created
	**$\ce{Zn(g) + 2HCl(aq) -> ZnCl2(aq) + H2 ^}$**
1)  #### Formation of precipitate
		An insoluble salt may be created in a reaction. The insoluble sale is called a precipitate.
	**$\ce{Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) -> CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)}$**
